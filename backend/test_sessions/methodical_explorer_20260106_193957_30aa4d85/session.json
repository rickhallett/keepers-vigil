The Companion gestures toward the figure near the archway.\n\nThe traveler flickers like a candle flame, sometimes solid, sometimes translucent. Their face holds the bewildered expression of someone grasping for memories that slip away like water. They turn toward you with eyes that struggle to focus, lips moving in soundless questions. This one feels different somehow, though you cannot yet say why.\n\nThe archway stands patient as always, its ancient stones worn smooth by the passage of countless souls. The strange light pulses gently overhead, casting everything in its soft, timeless glow.

Not the details, but the feeling of it. Like I've been waiting here before, or should have been.\" A pause. \"Do you know how I came to be here?\"\n\nThe traveler's gaze returns to you with a mixture of hope and uncertainty, as if you might hold the key to memories that keep slipping away like smoke.

Every corridor you've walked, every archway you've passed beneath, rendered in the methodical strokes of an engineer's hand. Measurements run along the margins in a script that flows like water yet remains utterly alien. Cross-sections reveal the station's bones: conduits threading through walls, power sources that hum with purposes you can't fathom, chambers you haven't yet discovered.\n\nThis was built. Planned. The realization settles over you like dust in an abandoned room. Someone\u2014or something\u2014designed every curve of this liminal space with deliberate intent. The gentle architecture that feels so natural, so inevitable, was once lines on a page just like these.\n\n\"You've found something interesting,\" the Companion observes, its voice carrying a note of careful neutrality.

Rivers flow uphill. Mountain chains form perfect spirals that should collapse under their own geometry. Cities are marked in places where the terrain could never support them\u2014floating above chasms, nestled inside active volcanoes, built on the surface of what appears to be a small moon orbiting dangerously close to a much larger world.\n\nThe Companion drifts closer, its presence a gentle warmth at your shoulder. \"Some maps chart what was,\" it says quietly. \"Others show what might have been.

The Companion gestures toward the figure near the archway.\n\nThe traveler flickers like a candle flame, sometimes solid, sometimes translucent. Their face holds the bewildered expression of someone grasping for memories that slip away like water. They turn toward you with eyes that struggle to focus, lips moving in soundless questions. This one feels different somehow, though you cannot yet say why.\n\nThe archway stands patient as always, its ancient stones worn smooth by the passage of countless souls. The strange light pulses gently overhead, casting everything in its soft, timeless glow.

Not the details, but the feeling of it. Like I've been waiting here before, or should have been.\" A pause. \"Do you know how I came to be here?\"\n\nThe traveler's gaze returns to you with a mixture of hope and uncertainty, as if you might hold the key to memories that keep slipping away like smoke.

Each holds its own archaeology\u2014fragments of lives that touched this place briefly before moving on. A child's drawing here, faded to sepia. There, a technical manual for some machine that no longer exists. The accumulation of centuries, waiting.\n\nThe Companion moves with you, its attention shifting between the shelves with what might be called fondness. \"Every object tells part of someone's story,\" it says quietly. \"Though few who pass through realize how much of themselves they leave behind.\"\n\nThe Repository extends deeper into the station, where more shelves disappear into gentle gloom.

Every corridor you've walked, every archway you've passed beneath, rendered in the methodical strokes of an engineer's hand. Measurements run along the margins in a script that flows like water yet remains utterly alien. Cross-sections reveal the station's bones: conduits threading through walls, power sources that hum with purposes you can't fathom, chambers you haven't yet discovered.\n\nThis was built. Planned. The realization settles over you like dust in an abandoned room. Someone\u2014or something\u2014designed every curve of this liminal space with deliberate intent. The gentle architecture that feels so natural, so inevitable, was once lines on a page just like these.\n\n\"You've found something interesting,\" the Companion observes, its voice carrying a note of careful neutrality.

No wind disturbs it here, no footfall but yours has stirred these ancient sediments. Each grain seems to hold the memory of countless cycles, of all the souls who have passed through this station and moved on to whatever lies beyond. Time flows strangely in this place, pooling and eddying like still water.\n\nThe dust clings to your hands with strange persistence, as if reluctant to be disturbed from its eternal rest. When you brush it away, it falls more slowly than it should, defying gravity's pull for just a moment longer than seems natural.\n\nThe archive stretches around you, its shelves holding their silent vigil.

A careful control that wasn't there moments ago.\n\nThe crystal grows warmer in your palm, its pulse matching the rhythm of your own heartbeat. The Companion takes a small step back, and in that simple movement, you sense the weight of centuries. Of watching. Of waiting. Of questions that have never been asked.\n\nYou could ask the Companion about the crystal directly, or examine the technical diagrams again to see if they reveal more about what you're holding.

Rivers flow uphill. Mountain chains form perfect spirals that should collapse under their own geometry. Cities are marked in places where the terrain could never support them\u2014floating above chasms, nestled inside active volcanoes, built on the surface of what appears to be a small moon orbiting dangerously close to a much larger world.\n\nThe Companion drifts closer, its presence a gentle warmth at your shoulder. \"Some maps chart what was,\" it says quietly. \"Others show what might have been.

Both paths have their wisdom.\" It pauses, seeming to consider something. \"What draws your curiosity most strongly?\"\n\nThe soft hum of the station's systems fills the brief silence.
