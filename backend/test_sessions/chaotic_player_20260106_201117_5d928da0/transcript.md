## Session Transcript

### Turn 0

**Command:** `[GAME START]`

You wake, as you have many times before.

The threshold stretches before you—stone archways framing an entrance that shifts at the edges of your vision. Light comes from everywhere and nowhere. The air is still, patient. This is the station between, and you are its keeper.

The companion is here, as always. A presence more than a form, warm and attentive. "Another has arrived," it says. "They are... confused. As they often are."

Near the archway, a figure waits. The traveler. They flicker slightly, not quite solid, not quite here. They look around with the expression of someone trying to remember a dream.

You know what to do. You have always known. But something about this one feels different.

Perhaps you should speak to the traveler, or ask your companion what they've observed. You could explore the keeper's cell or the archive. The station holds many secrets, and some of them may matter now.
