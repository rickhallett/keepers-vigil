The station serves those who need time to remember, to understand, to let go.\"\n\nIt moves closer, not quite touching but offering presence. \"Your role as Keeper is not complex, though it is profound. You tend to those who arrive here\u2014the travelers who have forgotten themselves, who carry burdens too heavy for passage. You help them find what they need. Sometimes that is memory. Sometimes it is peace. Sometimes simply acknowledgment that they existed.\"\n\nThe ancient mechanisms around you hum softly, as if responding to the Companion's words. From here, you can see passages leading north toward what appears to be a control room, and east toward chambers that feel more intimate, more personal. \"There is no urgency in this work,\" the Companion continues. \"Time moves differently here. What matters is attention. Presence. The willingness to witness.\"\n\nYou might explore the station's chambers, examine the curious machinery around you, or ask the Companion to explain more about the travelers who come here.",

Each Keeper who has walked these halls has wondered about their purpose, about the nature of this place.\" The Companion moves closer, its presence both comforting and enigmatic. \"The station exists between moments, between breaths. It catches those who have lost their way in the crossing.\"\n\n\"The Traveler you tend now is like many who come here\u2014fractured by the journey, scattered across memory and dream. Some remember quickly. Others...\" It pauses, considering. \"Others require more time. More care. Your role is to provide that sanctuary, that gentle guidance back to wholeness.\"\n\nThe Companion gestures toward the archway that leads north to the corridor, then glances at the alcove to the east where the Traveler rests. \"Each soul finds its own path to understanding. Some through conversation, some through exploration, some through the simple act of being witnessed in their confusion. What draws your attention now?\"",

Others linger, like your traveler, piecing together fragments of who they were.\" Their voice grows quieter, more thoughtful. \"The station remembers them all, in its way. Each keeper who has served.

Like I should remember.\"\n\nThey turn to you then, and their eyes hold a desperate clarity. \"You're the one who tends this station, aren't you? I can sense it somehow. But why am I here? I was working on something important, something that could...\" The words trail off, frustration flickering across their features. \"I should move on. Every part of me knows that. But how? I can't remember how.\"\n\nThe Traveler's gaze drifts back to the console, then toward the observation windows where stars wheel slowly in their ancient dance. \"Help me understand. Please.\"\n\nThe Companion watches from across the chamber, patient and still.

They chose to continue. I wonder if I gave them enough time.*\" But as you turn the pages, the handwriting shifts. Different hands, different inks. Different centuries, perhaps. One keeper writes in flowing script about travelers who spoke of wars you've never heard of. Another uses short, careful strokes to describe helping someone who remembered only starlight and the sound of waves.\n\nThe most recent entries are in a hand you almost recognize, though you cannot place it. \"*The companion says I'm learning. Learning what, I wonder? Each traveler teaches me something I hadn't known I needed to understand.*\" The final entry is unfinished, ending mid-sentence: \"*Today someone arrived who reminded me of\u2014*\"\n\nYou close the journal, the weight of continuity settling around you like a familiar coat.

Others have called it the Threshold, the Crossing, the Last Harbor.\" It moves with unhurried grace, hands clasped behind its back. \"But names are just sounds, aren't they? What matters is its purpose.\"\n\nThe Companion turns toward the curved walls, where ancient light plays across surfaces that seem to breathe with their own rhythm. \"It exists to ease transition. To provide comfort to those who are confused, frightened, or simply unprepared for what comes next. And to give keepers like yourself a sacred duty\u2014to tend the flame of compassion in this between-space.\" Its gaze returns to you, warm and steady. \"Every keeper has understood this place differently.

Where normal illumination would create shadows, this radiance flows around objects like water, touching every surface with the same soft clarity. It makes the technical diagrams on the nearby table seem almost ethereal, their precise lines floating in the gentle glow. Even the traveler, sitting motionless in their chair, appears touched by something beyond the physical\u2014their confused features softened, given a quality of peace despite their inner turmoil.\n\nYou notice how the light doesn't hurt your eyes, no matter how long you study it. It asks nothing of you, demands no squinting or adjustment. It simply illuminates, as patient and eternal as this station itself.\n\nThe companion observes your contemplation with quiet interest. \"Light without source,\" it says eventually. \"The builders understood that souls departing need neither brightness nor shadow\u2014only clarity.\"\n\nYou could examine the technical diagrams more closely, speak with the traveler about what they remember, or move north through the archway to continue exploring the station.",

Someone\u2014or something\u2014designed this place with careful intention. Every curve serves a purpose beyond beauty.\n\nYou trace one of the annotations with your finger.

What matters is its purpose.\"\n\nThe Companion turns toward the curved walls, where ancient light plays across surfaces that seem to breathe with their own rhythm. \"It exists to ease transition. To provide comfort to those who are confused, frightened, or simply unprepared for what comes next. And to give keepers like yourself a sacred duty\u2014to tend the flame of compassion in this between-space.\" Its gaze returns to you, warm and steady. \"Every keeper has understood this place differently.
