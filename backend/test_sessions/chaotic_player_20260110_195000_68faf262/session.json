The traveler stares at their own hands with wonder and confusion, watching them fade in and out of solidity.\n\nThe archway frames them perfectly\u2014ancient stone carved with symbols that predate memory, marking the boundary between what was and what might be. You have guided others through this threshold. You know the weight of each moment here, the careful balance required. But this traveler feels different somehow. More present. More... questioning.\n\nYou can speak with the traveler, still lost in their new state, or turn to your Companion for guidance. The archway draws your eye with its patient carvings, and the strange light above seems to pulse with quiet expectation.

Shelves rise along the walls like silent sentinels, their surfaces crowded with the accumulated debris of centuries\u2014fragments that have somehow found their way to this liminal place. Most of what rests here appears mundane at first glance, yet something in the quality of light suggests otherwise.\n\nYour companion stands nearby, watching with patient attention as you take in your surroundings. Dust motes drift lazily through the air, caught in shafts of amber light that filter down from sources unseen. Among the collected objects, technical diagrams catch your eye\u2014their precise lines standing out against the softer forms around them. A faded map lies partially visible beneath other papers, its edges worn smooth by countless years.\n\nAt the far end of the archive, a gentle glow emanates from a doorway\u2014the passage onward. The light seems warm but distant, neither beckoning nor forbidding. Your companion glances toward it briefly, then back to you with a look of quiet understanding.\n\nYou could examine the shelves more closely, study the technical diagrams, or trace the routes on that faded map. The threshold through which you entered remains open behind you, while the passage waits with infinite patience ahead.",

The air here carries a faint scent of old paper and something else\u2014perhaps the lingering presence of those who kept watch before you.\n\nThrough the open doorway, you can return to the main hall where your duties await. The quiet here is different from the hall's expectant hush\u2014more personal, touched with the weight of solitary hours.\n\nYou might examine the papers on the desk, look through the journal, or return to the hall to begin your vigil.",

The traveler stares at their own hands with wonder and confusion, watching them fade in and out of solidity.\n\nThe archway frames them perfectly\u2014ancient stone carved with symbols that predate memory, marking the boundary between what was and what might be. You have guided others through this threshold. You know the weight of each moment here, the careful balance required. But this traveler feels different somehow. More present. More... questioning.\n\nYou can speak with the traveler, still lost in their new state, or turn to your Companion for guidance. The archway draws your eye with its patient carvings, and the strange light above seems to pulse with quiet expectation. Your cell waits down one path, while the Archive beckons down another\u2014both familiar refuges in this place between worlds.",
