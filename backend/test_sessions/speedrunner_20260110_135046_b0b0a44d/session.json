There's no surprise in its tone, only the patient acknowledgment of duty renewed. It stands near the great archway that dominates the far wall, ancient stone carved with symbols that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them.\n\nThe Traveler waits nearby, form wavering like heat shimmer. Their confusion is palpable\u2014the usual disorientation of arrival, the grasping for memories that slip away like smoke. They turn toward you with hollow, searching eyes, then away again, lost in the space between remembering and forgetting.\n\nYou could speak with the Traveler, try to ease their passage with gentle words. The Companion might have insights to share, as it always does. The archway draws your attention with its patient mysteries, and the strange light above pulses with its own rhythm.

If we cannot know what waits beyond, we can at least make the crossing gentle.*\n\nYou turn the page. *Today I watched the first soul pass through. The transition was seamless, peaceful.

There's no surprise in its tone, only the patient acknowledgment of duty renewed. It stands near the great archway that dominates the far wall, ancient stone carved with symbols that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them.\n\nThe Traveler waits nearby, form wavering like heat shimmer. Their confusion is palpable\u2014the usual disorientation of arrival, the grasping for memories that slip away like smoke. They turn toward you with hollow, searching eyes, then away again, lost in the space between remembering and forgetting.\n\nYou could speak with the Traveler, try to ease their passage with gentle words. The Companion might have insights to share, as it always does. The archway draws your attention with its patient mysteries, and the strange light above pulses with its own rhythm.

My hands remember the motions but...\" They flex their fingers, watching the movement with bewilderment. \"There were diagrams. Calculations. People depending on me.\" A pause, longer this time. \"But I can't see their faces anymore.\"\n\nThe traveler's gaze drifts past you toward the gentle luminescence emanating from the console area to the east, then back to their hands. \"This place feels... familiar. Like I've been walking toward it for a very long time. But I don't remember walking. I don't remember arriving.\" They look at you again, something almost desperate flickering across their features. \"Do you know what I was building?

The architecture doesn't match any period I know, but the materials... they respond to consciousness somehow, don't they?\"\n\nThe traveler rises unsteadily from the bench, one hand reaching toward the softly glowing walls. \"I feel like I should be somewhere else. Like there's something I need to do, someone waiting for me. But every time I try to remember where...\" They shake their head, frustrated. \"It's like trying to hold water. Why can't I just... go?\"\n\nTheir gaze drifts toward the doorway leading back to the central chamber, then to the corridor that continues deeper into the station. \"Can you help me understand? Or at least tell me\u2014am I supposed to walk through one of those passages?

A photograph, its edges curled with age, rests against what might once have been a piece of advanced circuitry.\n\nThe Companion moves quietly beside you, its presence a steady warmth in the stillness. \"Much passes through on its way elsewhere,\" it says, voice soft with something like reverence. \"Not everything finds its proper destination immediately. Some things... linger.\"\n\nDust motes drift through shafts of that sourceless light, and you catch glimpses of text in languages you don't recognize, symbols that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them.

Cross-sections reveal the hidden bones of walls, the careful engineering of corridors. Measurements march along edges in symbols that feel almost familiar, as if glimpsed in half-remembered dreams. The annotations cluster around key structural points\u2014the great dome overhead, the placement of each alcove, even the positioning of the memorial wall where names shimmer in eternal light.\n\nThis place was planned. Built. Someone sat with stylus and calculation, designing each chamber for its purpose. The realization settles over you like dust from forgotten archives. In the corner of one sheet, a partial symbol catches your eye\u2014the same mark you've noticed carved discretely into doorframes throughout the station.\n\nThe companion watches you study the diagrams, its luminous form reflected in the strange material. It says nothing, but you sense a careful attention in its silence, as if your discovery has shifted something in the air between you.\n\nYou could examine the memorial wall more closely, or perhaps ask the companion about what you've found.

The handwriting grows looser, more urgent. *We know our time grows short,* one passage reads. *The signals fade, the power dims, but this work\u2014this must endure. If we cannot know what waits beyond, we can at least make the crossing gentle.*\n\nYou turn the page. *Today I watched the first soul pass through. The transition was seamless, peaceful. We have built something good here, something that will continue long after our own voices fall silent.* The companion moves closer, its presence warm against your shoulder. \"That phrase,\" it says quietly, \"about making the crossing gentle. I remember those words. They were... important to us.\"\n\nThe journal's final entries speak of departure, of systems left running, of trust placed in what they had created.

Not the natural pause of someone examining something, but the sudden stillness of held breath. You can feel their attention fixed on the object in your hands, though when you glance up, their expression remains carefully neutral.\n\n\"That is...\" the companion begins, then falls silent. The usual warmth in their voice has shifted to something more careful, more distant. \"Where did you find that?\"\n\nThe crystal continues its soft pulsing against your palm. In the quiet of the archive chamber, you can hear the faint hum it makes\u2014barely audible, but present. The companion takes a small step back, their gaze never leaving the crystalline record.
