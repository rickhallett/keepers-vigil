The same flowing script that covered the diagrams spirals across its faceted surface, catching the pale light and throwing it back in gentle fractals.\n\nThe moment your fingers close around it, a low hum travels up your arms. It's rhythmic, steady. Like a heartbeat made of light and resonance. You've handled many artifacts in this place, but nothing quite like this. Nothing that felt so... present.\n\nThe companion has gone completely still. Not the relaxed stillness of rest, but the frozen quiet of someone who has just seen something they hoped never to see again. Its usual warmth seems to draw inward, leaving only the faintest glow in its form.\n\n\"Where did you find that?\" The words come carefully, each one measured and placed with deliberate precision. There's something new in the companion's voice\u2014not fear exactly, but a kind of recognition that sits heavy between you both.\n\nYou could examine the object more closely, or perhaps it's time to ask the companion what this crystal truly means. The soft archway to the north leads back toward the central hub, should you need to set this discovery aside for now.",
