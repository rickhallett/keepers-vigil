Not fire.\"\n\nThe Traveler's gaze drifts to the softly glowing panels embedded in the walls, then back to you. \"I remember building things. Circuits. Systems that would last. But I can't remember why it mattered.\" A pause. A flicker of clarity crosses their features. \"Were you waiting for me?\"\n\nThe quiet of the chamber settles around you both.

The archway itself might hold answers, as might the strange light that illuminates this space. Your cell waits to the west if you need a moment to gather yourself, while the archive to the east holds the accumulated wisdom of countless vigils.",

They look up at your approach, eyes unfocused but trying to find purchase on something familiar.\n\n\"I... thank you. For letting me sit.\" Their voice carries the weight of exhaustion. \"I was walking somewhere. Important work, I think. There was... there was something I built? The details keep...\" They trail off, fingers tracing absent patterns in the air. \"Do you know this place? The walls, they're so old. Ancient stone, but the light feels... wrong. Not electric. Not fire.\"\n\nThe Traveler's gaze drifts to the softly glowing panels embedded in the walls, then back to you. \"I remember building things. Circuits. Systems that would last. But I can't remember why it mattered.\" A pause. A flicker of clarity crosses their features. \"Were you waiting for me?\"\n\nThe quiet of the chamber settles around you both. To the east, the archway leads deeper into the station's heart, while the western passage curves away into gentle shadows. Your Companion remains nearby, patient and watchful.",

The air carries the faint scent of old paper and distant rain.\n\nLight filters through tall, narrow windows, casting gentle patterns across the floor where dust motes drift in lazy spirals. The shelves hold an eclectic collection\u2014worn books with faded spines, small personal effects wrapped in soft cloth, documents rolled and tied with ribbon that has lost its color to time. Most appear ordinary, the everyday possessions people carry with them. Yet something about their arrangement suggests they once meant everything to someone.\n\nYour footsteps echo softly on the polished stone floor as you move deeper into the space. The Companion mentioned this room holds fragments from the world outside, pieces that wash up here like driftwood on some metaphysical shore.\n\nFrom here, you can continue north to the Central Chamber where the Companion waits, or explore what secrets these accumulated belongings might hold.",

The diagrams reveal themselves in precise, technical detail: cross-sections of corridors you've walked, elevation views of chambers you've seen, circuit patterns that snake through walls like the nervous system of some vast, sleeping creature.\n\nThe measurements are exact, marked in a script that flows like water but carries the weight of mathematics. Every arch, every pillar, every gentle curve of this place has been planned. Calculated. Built with intention by minds that understood both engineering and grace. The annotations cluster around certain areas\u2014power conduits, perhaps, or systems whose purpose remains hidden in the flowing, alien text.\n\n\"Curious, aren't they?\" The Companion's voice carries a note you haven't heard before. Something almost like... caution? \"Such careful documentation.\"\n\nThe realization settles over you like dust: this station, with all its organic curves and weathered stone, was constructed. Designed by someone. The weight of that knowledge changes how you see the shadows, the way light falls through distant archways. Who built this place between worlds? And why?\n\nYou could examine the sheets more closely, perhaps speak with the Companion about their origins, or continue your exploration\u2014the archway to the north beckons with its promise of deeper mysteries, while the passage south leads back toward familiar territory.",

As your fingers trace the symbols, a subtle vibration travels up your arm\u2014not quite sound, not quite sensation. A heartbeat made of light and memory.\n\nThe companion, who had been moving quietly about the chamber, stops completely. The soft luminescence that usually emanates from its form dims to almost nothing. When you glance toward it, you notice something you've never seen before: stillness so profound it seems like absence.\n\n\"You've found it,\" the companion says finally, its voice carrying a note you can't quite identify. Not sadness, not fear\u2014something deeper. \"I wondered when you would.\"\n\nThe crystalline record continues its gentle pulse against your palm. The chamber around you feels different now, as though the discovery has shifted some invisible balance. The technical diagrams on the walls seem to glow more brightly, responding to the object's proximity.\n\nYou could examine the diagrams more closely with this new context, or perhaps it's time to speak with the companion about what you've discovered.
